Process: calculate Cover Charge (cal_cover_charge)
1.Start
2.Pass empty cost_stucture to process
3.Determine System total ticket charge
4.Set cost_structure-> total ticket charge = System total ticket charge
5.Prompt user to enter no. of children, no. of adults, no. of seniors
6.Store value to cost_structure-> num_of_children, pass_structure-> num_of_adult, pass_structure-> num_of_senior
7. cost_structure-> cover_charge =(cost_structure-> num_of_children*0.75)
    cost_structure-> cover_charge =(cost_structure-> num_of_adult*4.00)
    cost_structure-> cover_charge =(cost_structure-> num_of_senior*1.50)
8. Output updated cost_structure
9.Stop

*Testing for process: Cover charge*
Prompt user to enter no. of children, no. of adults, no. of seniors
lets take: num_of_senior = 3, num_of_adult = 1, num_of_children = 2
cover charge for seniors(3 senior) = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
cover charge for adults(1 adult)= 1 * $4.00 = $4.00
cover charge for children(2 children) = 2 * $0.75 = $1.50

Here, num_of_adult = 1 , num_of_senior = 0, num_of_children = 0
then,
cover charge for seniors(0 senior) = 0 * $1.50 = $0.00
cover charge for adults(1 adult)= 1 * $4.00 = $4.00
cover charge for children(0 children) = 0* $0.75 = $0.00
Therefore, the sum of cover charge will be  $4.00
 

Process: calculate Ticket Charge (cal_ticket_price)
1.Start
2.Pass cost_structure to process
3.Prompt user to enter to chose between musical ticket cost and theatre ticket cost
4.Store value to cost_structure-> musical_ticket or pass_structure->theatre_ticket
5. if (cost_structure-> musical ticket)
         a) if (cost_structure->time = (12pm - 4pm))
             i) cost_structure-> musical_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*70.00)
         b) else if (cost_structure->time = (6pm - 9pm))
            i) cost_structure-> musical_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*150.00)

   else if (cost_structure-> theatre ticket)
        a) if (cost_structure->time = (12pm - 4pm))
             i) cost_structure-> theatre_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*55.00)
       b) else if (cost_structure->time = (6pm - 9pm))
            i) cost_structure-> theatre_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*115.00)
6. Output updated cost_structure
7. Stop

*Question Answer*
Answer 1) num_of_senior =1, num_of_adults = 2, num_of_children = 1
Here, user chooses musical ticket.
Therefore, it was further asked to enter the timing (morning or evening)
The user chooses the time 8pm (evening)
num_of_people= num_of_children + num_of_adult + num_of_senior = 4 people
Therefore, 
cost_structure-> musical_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*150.00)
here, musical_ticket = (4 * 150.00) = $600.00

Answer 2)num_of_senior =1, num_of_adults = 2, num_of_children = 1
Here, user chooses musical ticket.
Therefore, it was further asked to enter the timing (morning or evening)
The user chooses the time 3pm (morning)
num_of_people= num_of_children + num_of_adult + num_of_senior = 4 people
Therefore, 
cost_structure-> musical_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*70.00)
here, musical_ticket = (4 * 70.00) = $280.00

Answer 3)num_of_senior =1, num_of_adults = 2, num_of_children = 1
Here, user chooses theatre ticket.
Therefore, it was further asked to enter the timing (morning or evening)
The user chooses the time 8pm (evening)
num_of_people= num_of_children + num_of_adult + num_of_senior = 4 people
Therefore, 
cost_structure-> theatre_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*115.00)
here, musical_ticket = (4 * 115.00) = $460.00

Answer 4)num_of_senior =1, num_of_adults = 2, num_of_children = 1
Here, user chooses theatre ticket.
Therefore, it was further asked to enter the timing (morning or evening)
The user chooses the time 2pm (morning)
num_of_people= num_of_children + num_of_adult + num_of_senior = 4 people
Therefore, 
cost_structure-> theatre_ticket = (cost_structure-> num_of_people*150.00)
here, musical_ticket = (4 * 55.00) = $220.00
