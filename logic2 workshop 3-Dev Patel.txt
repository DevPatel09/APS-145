pseudocode:
1)Start

2)Declartion of variables: early_state(Possible output = RED, AMBER, GREEN) , 
                                                 present_state(Possible output = RED, AMBER, GREEN),
                                                  
3)Set the initial time: start_time = (now
                                          current_time = 0,
                                          time_difference = current_time - start_time,

4)Capture the current time: start_time = (now)
                                                      current_time = (now),
                                                      time_difference = 0,
5)If early_state = RED,
        Then a) Present state will be AMBER.
                       present_state = AMBER
                  b) Set current time
                      current_time = (now)
                 c) time_difference = 10 sec
                                           Then GREEN light will be displayed
                                           set early_state = AMBER
                                           set present_state = GREEN

   else if early_state = AMBER,
          Then a) Present state will be GREEN.
                          present_state = GREEN
                     b) Set current time
                          current_time = (now)
                    c) time_difference = 40 sec
                                         Then RED light will be displayed
                                        set early_state = GREEN
                                        set present_state = RED

   else early_state = GREEN
         Then a) Present state will be RED.
                         present_state = RED
                    b) Set current time
                         current_time = (now)
                    c) time_difference = 70 sec
                                         Then AMBER light will be displayed
                                        set early_state = RED
                                        set present_state = AMBER
